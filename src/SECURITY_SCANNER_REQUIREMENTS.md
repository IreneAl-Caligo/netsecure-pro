# Requirements for Real Security Scanning Functionality

This document outlines what would be needed to enable the scanners in this application to use real, real-time data instead of simulated results.

## General Requirements

1. **Backend API Server**: 
   - All scanning operations need to be performed from a server, not a browser.
   - Browser security restrictions prevent direct network access (including port scanning, packet sniffing, etc.).
   - A Node.js, Python, or similar backend service would be required.

2. **API Keys for Security Services**:
   - Commercial or open-source security scanning APIs
   - Security scanning services often require paid subscriptions

3. **User Permissions and Legal Considerations**:
   - Scanning networks or websites without permission may be illegal
   - Proper authorization and scope limitations are essential

## Specific Scanner Requirements

### Web Vulnerability Scanner

1. **API Integration**:
   - Integration with services like OWASP ZAP API, Acunetix, Nessus, or similar
   - Proper API key management and request throttling

2. **Backend Processing**:
   - The backend would need to:
     - Make requests to the target website
     - Analyze HTTP headers and responses
     - Test for common vulnerabilities
     - Process and categorize results

3. **Real-world Implementation**:
   - Use a headless browser for dynamic testing
   - Implement scanning methodologies from OWASP Testing Guide
   - Track CVE database for known vulnerabilities

### Network Scanner

1. **Privileged Network Access**:
   - Root/admin privileges on the scanning machine
   - Access to raw sockets for ARP, ICMP, and TCP scanning
   - Network configuration permissions

2. **Tools Integration**:
   - Integration with tools like Nmap, Masscan, or similar
   - API wrapper around these tools

3. **Real-world Implementation**:
   - Support for various scanning techniques (ARP, ping sweep, etc.)
   - MAC address resolution and vendor lookup
   - OS fingerprinting capabilities

### Traffic Analyzer

1. **Network Interface Access**:
   - Access to promiscuous mode on network interfaces
   - Packet capture capabilities (requires admin privileges)
   - Integration with packet capture libraries (libpcap, WinPcap, etc.)

2. **Processing Requirements**:
   - High-performance packet processing
   - Protocol analysis libraries
   - Storage for packet metadata

3. **Real-world Implementation**:
   - Integration with tools like Wireshark, tcpdump, or similar
   - Real-time traffic visualization
   - Protocol-specific analysis

### Port Scanner with IDS

1. **Access Requirements**:
   - Ability to create raw sockets for SYN/FIN/NULL scans
   - Permission to perform port connection attempts
   - Network monitoring privileges

2. **IDS Components**:
   - Pattern matching engine for traffic analysis
   - Rule database for detecting attack signatures
   - Alert management and logging system

3. **Real-world Implementation**:
   - Integration with tools like Nmap for port scanning
   - Integration with Snort, Suricata, or similar for IDS functionality
   - Regular updates to signature database

## Implementation Approaches

### 1. Self-hosted Backend

Create a backend service using Node.js, Python, or similar that:
- Runs with appropriate system privileges
- Integrates with security tools via their CLI or APIs
- Exposes a secure API for the frontend

### 2. Cloud-based Security Services

- Use commercial security scanning APIs
- Implement proper authentication and rate limiting
- Process and filter results for display

### 3. Electron/Desktop Application

- Package the application as a desktop app using Electron
- Gain access to system-level networking abilities
- Include bundled versions of security tools

## Security and Privacy Considerations

1. **API Key Protection**:
   - Never expose API keys in frontend code
   - Use a backend proxy for all API calls

2. **Result Storage**:
   - Consider the sensitivity of scan results
   - Implement proper encryption for stored data

3. **Rate Limiting and Access Control**:
   - Prevent abuse of scanning capabilities
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization
